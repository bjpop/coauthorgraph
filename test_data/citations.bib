  abstract    = "AIM: To examine whether peripheral blood methylation is
                 associated with risk of developing mature B-cell neoplasms
                 (MBCNs). MATERIALS \& METHODS: We conducted a case-control
                 study nested within a large prospective cohort. Peripheral
                 blood was collected from healthy participants. Cases of MBCN
                 were identified by linkage to cancer registries. Methylation
                 was measured using the Infinium(\textregistered{})
                 HumanMethylation450. RESULTS: During a median of 10.6-year
                 follow-up, 438 MBCN cases were evaluated. Global
                 hypomethylation was associated with increased risk of MBCN
                 (odds ratio: 2.27, [95\% CI: 1.59-3.25]). Within high CpG
                 promoter regions, hypermethylation was associated with
                 increased risk (odds ratio: 1.76 [95\% CI: 1.25-2.48]).
                 Promoter hypermethylation was observed in HOXA9 and CDH1
                 genes. CONCLUSION: Aberrant global DNA methylation is
                 detectable in peripheral blood collected years before
                 diagnosis and is associated with increased risk of MBCN,
                 suggesting changes to DNA methylation are an early event in
                 MBCN development.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The emergence and evolution of community-acquired
                 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains
                 in Africa is poorly understood. However, one particular MRSA
                 lineage called ST88, appears to be rapidly establishing itself
                 as an ``African'' CA-MRSA clone. In this study, we employed
                 whole genome sequencing to provide more information on the
                 genetic background of ST88 CA-MRSA isolates from Ghana and to
                 describe in detail ST88 CA-MRSA isolates in comparison with
                 other MRSA lineages worldwide. METHODS: We first established a
                 complete ST88 reference genome (AUS0325) using PacBio SMRT
                 sequencing. We then used comparative genomics to assess
                 relatedness among 17 ST88 CA-MRSA isolates recovered from
                 patients attending Buruli ulcer treatment centres in Ghana,
                 three non-African ST88s and 15 other MRSA lineages. RESULTS:
                 We show that Ghanaian ST88 forms a discrete MRSA lineage
                 (harbouring SCCmec-IV [2B]). Gene content analysis identified
                 five distinct genomic regions enriched among ST88 isolates
                 compared with the other S. aureus lineages. The Ghanaian ST88
                 isolates had only 658 core genome SNPs and there was no
                 correlation between phylogeny and geography, suggesting the
                 recent spread of this clone. The lineage was also resistant to
                 multiple classes of antibiotics including $\beta$-lactams,
                 tetracycline and chloramphenicol. DISCUSSION: This study
                 reveals that S. aureus ST88-IV is a recently emerging and
                 rapidly spreading CA-MRSA clone in Ghana. The study highlights
                 the capacity of small snapshot genomic studies to provide
                 actionable public health information in resource limited
                 settings. To our knowledge this is the first genomic
                 assessment of the ST88 CA-MRSA clone.",

                 the genus Sphingobacterium. The first isolate, R-53603T, was
                 obtained from purulent discharge from the toe of a cellulitis
                 patient in Kuwait. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
                 revealed 99.87\% identity of R-53603T with environmental
                 isolate P031 (= R-53745) originating from activated sludge in
                 Singapore. Both isolates were phylogenetically positioned on
                 the same sub-branch. Highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
                 was found with Sphingobacterium mizutaii LMG 8340T (98.23 \%),
                 Sphingobacterium lactis (97.78 \%) and Sphingobacterium
                 daejeonense (97.14 \%). DNA-DNA hybridizations showed <70 \%
                 relatedness between the two isolates and the type strains of
                 the close phylogenetic neighbors S. mizutaii (18.0-24.5 \%),
                 S. lactis (20.3-25.9 \%) and S. daejeonense (13.2-20.0 \%).

                 MK-7 as the dominant menaquinone and phosphatidylethanolamine
                 as the major polar lipid in strain R-53603T are typical
                 chemotaxonomic characteristics for members of the genus
                 Sphingobacterium. Phenotypic features most useful for
                 differentiation of the two novel strains from the most closely
                 related species S. mizutaii include growth on MacConkey agar,
                 and utilization of stachyose, guanidine HCl and lithium
                 chloride in Biolog GEN III. We conclude that R-53603T and

                 Sphingobacterium cellulitidis sp. nov. is proposed. The type

                 Enterococcus faecium (assigned the multi locus sequence type
                 ST796) was simultaneously isolated from geographically
                 separate hospitals in south eastern Australia and New Zealand.
                 Here we describe the complete genome sequence of Ef\_aus0233,
                 a representative ST796 E. faecium isolate. We used PacBio
                 single molecule real-time sequencing to establish a high
                 quality, fully assembled genome comprising a circular
                 chromosome of 2,888,087 bp and five plasmids. Comparison of
                 Ef\_aus0233 to other E. faecium genomes shows Ef\_aus0233 is a
                 member of the epidemic hospital-adapted lineage and has
                 evolved from an ST555-like ancestral progenitor by the
                 accumulation or modification of five mosaic plasmids and five
                 putative prophage, acquisition of two cryptic genomic islands,
                 accrued chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms and a 80
                 kb region of recombination, also gaining Tn1549 and Tn916,
                 transposons conferring resistance to vancomycin and
                 tetracycline respectively. The genomic dissection of this new
                 clone presented here underscores the propensity of the

                 (livestock-associated MRSA; LA-MRSA). Clonal complex 398
                 (CC398) is the most prevalent LA-MRSA clone, and has been
                 reported from several geographical settings, including Europe,
                 the Americas and Asia. To understand the factors contributing
                 to the global dissemination of this clone, we analysed CC398
                 MRSA isolates from New Zealand (NZ), a geographically isolated
                 country with an economy strongly dependent on livestock
                 farming. We supplemented the NZ CC398 MRSA collection with
                 global datasets of CC398 MRSA and CC398
                 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Here, we demonstrate
                 multiple sporadic incursions of CC398 MRSA into NZ, as well as
                 recent importation and spread of a swine-associated clade
                 related to the European LA-MRSA lineage. Within a larger
                 global phylogenomic framework, Bayesian modelling suggested
                 that this NZ clade emerged in the late 2000s, with a probable
                 origin in swine from Western Europe. Elucidating the factors
                 responsible for the incursion and spread of LA-MRSA in
                 geographically distant regions, such as NZ, provides important
                 insights into global pathways of S. aureus transmission, and
                 will inform strategies to control importation and spread.",

                 total of 56 cases of gastroenteritis, including seven
                 laboratory-confirmed cases of Campylobacter jejuni infection,
                 were identified in 235 eligible respondents. Univariate
                 analysis showed a significant association with a chicken liver
                 p{\^a}t{\'e} entr{\'e}e [relative risk (RR) 3·64, 95\%
                 confidence interval (CI) 2·03-6·52, P < 0·001], which retained
                 significance after adjustment for confounding via
                 multivariable analysis (adjusted RR 2·80, 95\% CI 1·26-6·19, P
                 = 0·01). C. jejuni and C. coli were also isolated in chicken
                 liver p{\^a}t{\'e} recovered from the college's kitchen.
                 Subsequent whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) of
                 clinical and food-derived C. jejuni isolates showed three
                 genetically distinct sequence types (STs) comprising ST528,
                 ST535 (both clinically derived) and ST991 (food derived). The
                 study demonstrates the value of utilizing complementary
                 sources of evidence, including genomic data, to support public
                 health investigations. The use of wgMLST highlights the

                 To gain understanding into possible routes of secondary
                 infection, we characterized S. aureus isolates from patient
                 lesions and surrounding environments across two Ghanaian
                 health centres. One hundred and one S. aureus isolates were
                 isolated from wounds (n = 93, 92.1\%) and the hospital
                 environment (n = 8, 7.9\%) and characterized by the spa gene,
                 mecA and the Panton-Valentine leucocidin toxin followed by spa
                 sequencing and whole genome sequencing of a subset of 49
                 isolates. Spa typing and sequencing of the spa gene from 91
                 isolates identified 29 different spa types with t355 (ST152),
                 t186 (ST88), and t346 dominating. Although many distinct
                 strains were isolated from both health centres, genotype
                 clustering was identified within centres. In addition, we
                 identified a cluster consisting of isolates from a healthcare
                 worker, patients dressed that same day and forceps used for
                 dressing, pointing to possible healthcare-associated
                 transmission. These clusters were confirmed by phylogenomic
                 analysis. Twenty-four (22.8\%) isolates were identified as
                 methicillin-resistant S. aureus and lukFS genes encoding
                 Panton-Valentine leucocidin were identified in 67 (63.8\%) of
                 the isolates. Phenotype screening showed widespread resistance
                 to tetracycline, erythromycin, rifampicin, amikacin and
                 streptomycin. Genomics confirmed the widespread presence of

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecium is a major nosocomial
                 pathogen causing significant morbidity and mortality
                 worldwide. Assessment of E. faecium using MLST to understand
                 the spread of this organism is an important component of
                 hospital infection control measures. Recent studies, however,
                 suggest that MLST might be inadequate for E. faecium
                 surveillance. OBJECTIVES: To use WGS to characterize recently
                 identified vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) isolates
                 non-typeable by MLST that appear to be causing a
                 multi-jurisdictional outbreak in Australia. METHODS: Illumina
                 NextSeq and Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing platforms were
                 used to determine the genome sequences of 66 non-typeable E.
                 faecium (NTEfm) isolates. Phylogenetic and bioinformatics
                 analyses were subsequently performed using a number of in
                 silico tools. RESULTS: Sixty-six E. faecium isolates were
                 identified by WGS from multiple health jurisdictions in
                 Australia that could not be typed by MLST due to a missing
                 pstS allele. SMRT sequencing and complete genome assembly
                 revealed a large chromosomal rearrangement in representative
                 strain DMG1500801, which likely facilitated the deletion of
                 the pstS region. Phylogenomic analysis of this population
                 suggests that deletion of pstS within E. faecium has arisen
                 independently on at least three occasions. Importantly, the
                 majority of these isolates displayed a vancomycin-resistant
                 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified NTEfm isolates that
                 appear to be causing a multi-jurisdictional outbreak in
                 Australia. Identification of these isolates has important
                 implications for MLST-based typing activities designed to
                 monitor the spread of VREfm and provides further evidence
                 supporting the use of WGS for hospital surveillance of E.

                 of the skin that infects humans and other animal species,
                 causing scabies, a contagious disease characterized by extreme
                 itching. Scabies infections are a major health problem,
                 particularly in remote Indigenous communities in Australia,
                 where co-infection of epidermal scabies lesions by Group A
                 Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus is thought to be
                 responsible for the high rate of rheumatic heart disease and
                 chronic kidney disease. We collected and separately sequenced
                 mite DNA from several pools of thousands of whole mites from a
                 porcine model of scabies (S. scabiei var. suis) and two human
                 patients (S. scabiei var. hominis) living in different regions
                 of northern Australia. Our sequencing samples the mite and its
                 metagenome, including the mite gut flora and the wound
                 micro-environment. Here, we describe the mitochondrial genome
                 of the scabies mite. We developed a new de novo assembly
                 pipeline based on a bait-and-reassemble strategy, which
                 produced a 14 kilobase mitochondrial genome sequence assembly.
                 We also annotated 35 genes and have compared these to other
                 Acari mites. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms
                 (SNPs) and used these to infer the presence of six haplogroups
                 in our samples, Remarkably, these fall into two
                 closely-related clades with one clade including both human and
                 pig varieties. This supports earlier findings that only
                 limited genetic differences may separate some human and animal
                 varieties, and raises the possibility of cross-host
                 infections. Finally, we used these mitochondrial haplotypes to
                 show that the genetic diversity of individual infections is
                 typically small with 1-3 distinct haplotypes per infestation.",

                 current approaches using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
                 (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multilocus
                 variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), binary typing,
                 and serotyping. Initially 423 L. monocytogenes isolates
                 underwent WGS, and comparisons uncovered a diverse genetic
                 population structure derived from three distinct lineages.
                 MLST, binary typing, and serotyping results inferred in silico
                 from the WGS data were highly concordant (>99\%) with
                 laboratory typing performed in parallel. However, WGS was able
                 to identify distinct nested clusters within groups of isolates
                 that were otherwise indistinguishable using our current typing
                 methods. Routine WGS was then used for prospective
                 epidemiologic surveillance on a further 97 L. monocytogenes
                 isolates over a 12-month period, which provided a greater
                 level of discrimination than that of conventional typing for
                 inferring linkage to point source outbreaks. A risk-based
                 alert system based on WGS similarity was used to inform
                 epidemiologists required to act on the data. Our experience
                 shows that WGS can be adopted for prospective L. monocytogenes

                 Sequencing (NGS) techniques allows, for the first time, to
                 distinguish relapses from reinfections in patients with
                 multiple Buruli ulcer (BU) episodes. METHODOLOGY: We compared
                 the number and location of single nucleotide polymorphisms
                 (SNPs) identified by genomic screening between four pairs of
                 Mycobacterium ulcerans isolates collected at the time of first
                 diagnosis and at recurrence, derived from a collection of
                 almost 5000 well characterized clinical samples from one BU
                 treatment center in Benin. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The findings
                 suggest that after surgical treatment-without antibiotics-the
                 second episodes were due to relapse rather than reinfection.
                 Since specific antibiotics were introduced for the treatment
                 of BU, the one patient with a culture available from both
                 disease episodes had M. ulcerans isolates with a genomic
                 distance of 20 SNPs, suggesting the patient was most likely
                 reinfected rather than having a relapse. CONCLUSIONS: To our
                 knowledge, this study is the first to study recurrences in M.
                 ulcerans using NGS, and to identify exogenous reinfection as
                 causing a recurrence of BU. The occurrence of reinfection
                 highlights the contribution of ongoing exposure to M. ulcerans
                 to disease recurrence, and has implications for vaccine

                 persisting mutations and only two mutations were detected in
                 the 7 years following cessation of treatment in 2004. In four
                 isolates there were mixed alleles, suggesting the likely
                 presence of bacterial subpopulations. The initial 1991 isolate
                 demonstrated genotypic resistance to isoniazid (katG W91R),
                 rifampicin (rpoB S531L), ethambutol (embB M306V), streptomycin
                 (gidB L16R), quinolones (gyrA S95T) and P-aminosalicylic acid
                 (thyA T202A). Subsequent resistance mutations developed for
                 pyrazinamide (pncA I31F) and ethionamide (ethA frameshift).
                 Such information might have been instructive when developing a
                 treatment regimen. In retrospect and with the benefit of
                 high-resolution genomic hindsight we were able to determine
                 that the patient received only one or two active
                 anti-tuberculous agents for most of their treatment.
                 Additionally, mutations in bacA and Rv2326c were detected,
                 which may have contributed to the persistent but mild disease
                 course. BacA is likely to be associated with maintenance of
                 chronic infection and Rv2326c with a decreased bacterial
                 metabolic state. These results expand our understanding of M.

                 displayed collagen binding ability. However, most strains in

                 The prevalence of a previously described C. perfringens
                 putative collagen adhesin-encoding gene was investigated by
                 PCR screening. It was found that five of the strains carried

  abstract    = "Bacitracins are mixtures of structurally related cyclic
                 polypeptides with antibiotic properties. They act by
                 interfering with the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall.
                 In this study, we analyzed an avian necrotic enteritis strain
                 of Clostridium perfringens that was resistant to bacitracin
                 and produced NetB toxin. We identified a bacitracin resistance
                 locus that resembled a bacitracin resistance determinant from
                 Enterococcus faecalis. It contained the structural genes
                 bcrABD and a putative regulatory gene, bcrR. Mutagenesis
                 studies provided evidence that both bcrA and bcrB are
                 essential for bacitracin resistance, and that evidence was
                 supported by the results of experiments in which the
                 introduction of both the bcrA and bcrB genes into a
                 bacitracin-susceptible C. perfringens strain was required to
                 confer bacitracin resistance. The wild-type strain was shown
                 to contain at least three large, putatively conjugative
                 plasmids, and the bcrRABD locus was localized to an 89.7-kb
                 plasmid, pJIR4150. This plasmid was experimentally shown to be
                 conjugative and was sequenced. The sequence revealed that it
                 also carries a tpeL toxin gene and is related to the pCW3
                 family of conjugative antibiotic resistance and toxin plasmids
                 from C. perfringens. The bcr genes were located on a genetic
                 element, ICECp1, which is related to the Tn916 family of
                 integrative conjugative elements (ICEs). ICECp1 appears to be
                 the first Tn916-like element shown to confer bacitracin
                 resistance. In summary, we identified in a toxin-producing C.
                 perfringens strain a novel mobile bacitracin resistance
                 element which was experimentally shown to be essential for
                 bacitracin resistance and is carried by a putative ICE located

                 To integrate gene expression with dynamics in poly(A) tail
                 length and adenylation site, we developed a targeted
                 next-generation sequencing approach, Poly(A)-Test
                 RNA-sequencing. PAT-seq returns (i) digital gene expression,
                 (ii) polyadenylation site/s, and (iii) the
                 polyadenylation-state within and between eukaryotic
                 transcriptomes. PAT-seq differs from previous 3' focused
                 RNA-seq methods in that it depends strictly on 3' adenylation
                 within total RNA samples and that the full-native poly(A) tail
                 is included in the sequencing libraries. Here, total RNA
                 samples from budding yeast cells were analyzed to identify the
                 intersect between adenylation state and gene expression in
                 response to loss of the major cytoplasmic deadenylase Ccr4.
                 Furthermore, concordant changes to gene expression and
                 adenylation-state were demonstrated in the classic
                 Crabtree-Warburg metabolic shift. Because all polyadenylated

                 small variations in ambient temperature have severe
                 consequences on their growth and development. Temperature
                 affects multiple aspects of plant development, but the
                 processes and mechanisms underlying thermo-sensitive growth
                 responses are mostly unknown. Here we exploit natural
                 variation in Arabidopsis thaliana to identify and characterize
                 novel components and processes mediating thermo-sensitive
                 growth responses in plants. Phenotypic screening of wild
                 accessions identified several strains displaying pleiotropic
                 growth defects, at cellular and organism levels, specifically
                 at high ambient temperatures. Positional cloning and
                 characterization of the underlying gene revealed that ICARUS1
                 (ICA1), which encodes a protein of the tRNAHis guanylyl
                 transferase (Thg1) superfamily, is required for plant growth
                 at high temperatures. Transcriptome and gene marker analyses
                 together with DNA content measurements show that ICA1
                 loss-of-function results in down regulation of cell cycle
                 associated genes at high temperatures, which is linked with a
                 block in G2/M transition and endoreduplication. In addition,
                 plants with mutations in ICA1 show enhanced sensitivity to DNA
                 damage. Characterization of additional strains that carry
                 lesions in ICA1, but display normal growth, shows that
                 alternative splicing is likely to alleviate the deleterious
                 effects of some natural mutations. Furthermore, analyses of
                 worldwide and regional collections of natural accessions
                 indicate that ICA1 loss-of-function has arisen several times
                 independently, and that these occur at high frequency in some
                 local populations. Overall our results suggest that
                 ICA1-mediated-modulation of fundamental processes such as
                 tRNAHis maturation, modify plant growth responses to
                 temperature changes in a quantitative and reversible manner,

  abstract    = "UNLABELLED: Infections caused by highly successful clones of
                 hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
                 aureus (HA-MRSA) are a major public health burden. The
                 globally dominant sequence type 239 (ST239) HA-MRSA clone has
                 persisted in the health care setting for decades, but the
                 basis of its success has not been identified. Taking a
                 collection of 123 ST239 isolates spanning 32 years, we have
                 used population-based functional genomics to investigate the
                 evolution of this highly persistent and successful clone.
                 Phylogenetic reconstruction and population modeling uncovered
                 a previously unrecognized distinct clade of ST239 that was
                 introduced into Australia from Asia and has perpetuated the
                 epidemic in this region. Functional analysis demonstrated
                 attenuated virulence and enhanced resistance to last-line
                 antimicrobials, the result of two different phenomena,
                 adaptive evolution within the original Australian ST239 clade
                 and the introduction of a new clade displaying shifts in both
                 phenotypes. The genetic diversity between the clades allowed
                 us to employ genome-wide association testing and identify
                 mutations in other essential regulatory systems, including
                 walKR, that significantly associate with and may explain these
                 key phenotypes. The phenotypic convergence of two
                 independently evolving ST239 clades highlights the very strong
                 selective pressures acting on HA-MRSA, showing that hospital
                 environments have favored the accumulation of mutations in
                 essential MRSA genes that increase resistance to
                 antimicrobials, attenuate virulence, and promote persistence
                 in the health care environment. Combinations of comparative
                 genomics and careful phenotypic measurements of longitudinal
                 collections of clinical isolates are giving us the knowledge
                 to intelligently address the impact of current and future
                 antibiotic usage policies and practices on hospital pathogens
                 globally. IMPORTANCE: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
                 aureus (MRSA) is responsible for innumerable drug-resistant
                 health care-associated infections globally. This study, the
                 first to investigate the evolutionary response of
                 hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) over many decades,
                 demonstrates how MRSA can persist in a region through the
                 reintroduction of a previously unrecognized distinct clade.
                 This study also demonstrates the crucial adaptive responses of
                 HA-MRSA to the highly selective environment of the health care
                 system, the evolution of MRSA isolates to even higher levels
                 of antibiotic resistance at the cost of attenuated virulence.
                 However, in vivo persistence is maintained, resulting in a
                 clone of HA-MRSA able to resist almost all antimicrobial
                 agents and still cause invasive disease in the heavily
                 compromised hosts found in modern health care settings.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Computational biology comprises a wide range of
              technologies and approaches. Multiple technologies can be
              combined to create more powerful workflows if the individuals
              contributing the data or providing tools for its interpretation
              can find mutual understanding and consensus. Much conversation
              and joint investigation are required in order to identify and
              implement the best approaches. Traditionally, scientific
              conferences feature talks presenting novel technologies or
              insights, followed up by informal discussions during coffee
              breaks. In multi-institution collaborations, in order to reach
              agreement on implementation details or to transfer deeper
              insights in a technology and practical skills, a representative
              of one group typically visits the other. However, this does not
              scale well when the number of technologies or research groups is
              large. Conferences have responded to this issue by introducing
              Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions, which offer an opportunity for
              individuals with common interests to intensify their interaction.
              However, parallel BoF sessions often make it hard for
              participants to join multiple BoFs and find common ground between
              the different technologies, and BoFs are generally too short to
              allow time for participants to program together. RESULTS: This
              report summarises our experience with computational biology
              Codefests, Hackathons and Sprints, which are interactive
              developer meetings. They are structured to reduce the limitations
              of traditional scientific meetings described above by
              strengthening the interaction among peers and letting the
              participants determine the schedule and topics. These meetings
              are commonly run as loosely scheduled ``unconferences''
              (self-organized identification of participants and topics for
              meetings) over at least two days, with early introductory talks
              to welcome and organize contributors, followed by intensive
              collaborative coding sessions. We summarise some prominent
              achievements of those meetings and describe differences in how
              these are organised, how their audience is addressed, and their
              outreach to their respective communities. CONCLUSIONS:
              Hackathons, Codefests and Sprints share a stimulating atmosphere
              that encourages participants to jointly brainstorm and tackle
              problems of shared interest in a self-driven proactive
              environment, as well as providing an opportunity for new
              participants to get involved in collaborative projects.",

  abstract    = "UNLABELLED: Footrot is a contagious, debilitating disease of
                 sheep, causing major economic losses in most sheep-producing
                 countries. The causative agent is the Gram-negative anaerobe
                 Dichelobacter nodosus. Depending on the virulence of the
                 infective bacterial strain, clinical signs vary from a mild
                 interdigital dermatitis (benign footrot) to severe
                 underrunning of the horn of the hoof (virulent footrot). The
                 aim of this study was to investigate the genetic relationship
                 between D. nodosus strains of different phenotypic virulences
                 and between isolates from different geographic regions. Genome
                 sequencing was performed on 103 D. nodosus isolates from eight
                 different countries. Comparison of these genome sequences
                 revealed that they were highly conserved, with >95\% sequence
                 identity. However, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of
                 the 31,627 nucleotides that were found to differ in one or
                 more of the 103 sequenced isolates divided them into two
                 distinct clades. Remarkably, this division correlated with
                 known virulent and benign phenotypes, as well as with the
                 single amino acid difference between the AprV2 and AprB2
                 proteases, which are produced by virulent and benign strains,
                 respectively. This division was irrespective of the geographic
                 origin of the isolates. However, within one of these clades,
                 isolates from different geographic regions generally belonged
                 to separate clusters. In summary, we have shown that D.
                 nodosus has a bimodal population structure that is globally
                 conserved and provide evidence that virulent and benign
                 isolates represent two distinct forms of D. nodosus strains.
                 These data have the potential to improve the diagnosis and
                 targeted control of this economically significant disease.
                 IMPORTANCE: The Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium
                 Dichelobacter nodosus is the causative agent of ovine footrot,
                 a disease of major importance to the worldwide sheep industry.
                 The known D. nodosus virulence factors are its type IV
                 fimbriae and extracellular serine proteases. D. nodosus
                 strains are designated virulent or benign based on the type of
                 disease caused under optimal climatic conditions. These
                 isolates have similar fimbriae but distinct extracellular
                 proteases. To determine the relationship between virulent and
                 benign isolates and the relationship of isolates from
                 different geographical regions, a genomic study that involved
                 the sequencing and subsequent analysis of 103 D. nodosus
                 isolates was undertaken. The results showed that D. nodosus
                 isolates are highly conserved at the genomic level but that
                 they can be divided into two distinct clades that correlate
                 with their disease phenotypes and with a single amino acid

  abstract    = "The Gram-negative bacterium Gallibacterium anatis is a major
                 cause of salpingitis and peritonitis in commercial egg-layers,
                 leading to reduced egg production and increased mortality.
                 Unfortunately, widespread multidrug resistance and antigenic
                 diversity makes it difficult to control infections and novel
                 prevention strategies are urgently needed. In this study, a
                 pan-genomic reverse vaccinology (RV) approach was used to
                 identify potential vaccine candidates. Firstly, the genomes of
                 10 selected Gallibacterium strains were analyzed and proteins
                 selected on the following criteria; predicted surface-exposure
                 or secretion, none or one transmembrane helix (TMH), and
                 presence in six or more of the 10 genomes. In total, 42
                 proteins were selected. The genes encoding 27 of these
                 proteins were successfully cloned in Escherichia coli and the
                 proteins expressed and purified. To reduce the number of
                 vaccine candidates for in vivo testing, each of the purified
                 recombinant proteins was screened by ELISA for their ability
                 to elicit a significant serological response with serum from
                 chickens that had been infected with G. anatis. Additionally,
                 an in silico prediction of the protective potential was
                 carried out based on a protein property prediction method. Of
                 the 27 proteins, two novel putative immunogens were
                 identified; Gab\_1309 and Gab\_2312. Moreover, three
                 previously characterized virulence factors; GtxA, FlfA and
                 Gab\_2156, were identified. Thus, by combining the pan-genomic
                 RV approach with subsequent in vitro and in silico screening,
                 we have narrowed down the pan-proteome of G. anatis to five
                 vaccine candidates. Importantly, preliminary immunization
                 trials indicated an in vivo protective potential of GtxA-N,

                 difficile infection between July 2011 and March 2012 from whom
                 an unusual C. difficile strain was isolated. This strain had a
                 single-nucleotide deletion of the tcdC gene at position 117
                 and binary toxin genes, which are characteristic of the
                 hypervirulent ribotype (RT) 027 strain. METHODS: A
                 retrospective cohort study of 12 patients infected with C.
                 difficile RT244 and 24 patients infected with
                 non-RT244/non-RT027 strains matched for place of diagnosis and
                 time of collection of specimen was performed. We performed
                 whole-genome sequencing to understand the relationship of the
                 RT244 strain to other C. difficile strains and further
                 understand its virulence potential. RESULTS: Clostridium
                 difficile RT244 was associated with more severe disease and a
                 higher mortality rate. Phylogenomic analysis using core genome
                 single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed that RT244 is in the
                 same genetic clade (clade 2) as RT027 but is distinct from all
                 RT027 strains. The pathogenicity locus of the RT244 strain
                 encodes a variant toxin B, and this was confirmed by
                 demonstration of Clostridium sordellii-like cytopathic effect
                 on Vero cells. Toxin B production in culture supernatants was

                 aureus (CA-MRSA) ST93 clone is becoming dominant in Australia
                 and is clinically highly virulent. In addition, sepsis and
                 skin infection models demonstrate that ST93 CA-MRSA is the
                 most virulent global clone of S. aureus tested to date. While
                 the determinants of virulence have been studied in other
                 clones of CA-MRSA, the basis for hypervirulence in ST93
                 CA-MRSA has not been defined. RESULTS: Here, using a
                 geographically and temporally dispersed collection of ST93
                 isolates we demonstrate that the ST93 population
                 hyperexpresses key CA-MRSA exotoxins, in particular
                 $\alpha$-hemolysin, in comparison to other global clones. Gene
                 deletion and complementation studies, and virulence
                 comparisons in a murine skin infection model, showed
                 unequivocally that increased expression of $\alpha$-hemolysin
                 is the key staphylococcal virulence determinant for this
                 clone. Genome sequencing and comparative genomics of strains
                 with divergent exotoxin profiles demonstrated that, like other
                 S. aureus clones, the quorum sensing agr system is the master
                 regulator of toxin expression and virulence in ST93 CA-MRSA.

                 AraC/XylS family regulator (AryK) that potentiates toxin

                 aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as a major public health problem
                 around the world. In Australia, ST93-IV[2B] is the dominant
                 CA-MRSA clone and displays significantly greater virulence
                 than other S. aureus. Here, we have examined the evolution of
                 ST93 via genomic analysis of 12 MSSA and 44 MRSA ST93
                 isolates, collected from around Australia over a 17-year
                 period. Comparative analysis revealed a core genome of 2.6 Mb,
                 sharing greater than 99.7\% nucleotide identity. The accessory
                 genome was 0.45 Mb and comprised additional mobile DNA
                 elements, harboring resistance to erythromycin, trimethoprim,
                 and tetracycline. Phylogenetic inference revealed a molecular
                 clock and suggested that a single clone of methicillin
                 susceptible, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive, ST93
                 S. aureus likely spread from North Western Australia in the
                 early 1970s, acquiring methicillin resistance at least twice
                 in the mid 1990s. We also explored associations between
                 genotype and important MRSA phenotypes including oxacillin MIC
                 and production of exotoxins ($\alpha$-hemolysin [Hla],
                 $\delta$-hemolysin [Hld], PSM$\alpha$3, and PVL). High-level
                 expression of Hla is a signature feature of ST93 and reduced
                 expression in eight isolates was readily explained by
                 mutations in the agr locus. However, subtle but significant
                 decreases in Hld were also noted over time that coincided with
                 decreasing oxacillin resistance and were independent of agr
                 mutations. The evolution of ST93 S. aureus is thus associated
                 with a reduction in both exotoxin expression and oxacillin
                 MIC, suggesting MRSA ST93 isolates are under pressure for

  abstract    = "Antigenic variation occurs in a broad range of species. This
                 process resembles gene conversion in that variant DNA is
                 unidirectionally transferred from partial gene copies (or
                 silent loci) into an expression locus. Previous studies of
                 antigenic variation have involved the amplification and
                 sequencing of individual genes from hundreds of colonies.
                 Using the pilE gene from Neisseria gonorrhoeae we have
                 demonstrated that it is possible to use PCR amplification,
                 followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing and a novel
                 assembly process, to detect individual antigenic variation
                 events. The ability to detect these events was much greater
                 than has previously been possible. In N. gonorrhoeae most
                 silent loci contain multiple partial gene copies. Here we show
                 that there is a bias towards using the copy at the 3' end of
                 the silent loci (copy 1) as the donor sequence. The pilE gene
                 of N. gonorrhoeae and some strains of Neisseria meningitidis
                 encode class I pilin, but strains of N. meningitidis from
                 clonal complexes 8 and 11 encode a class II pilin. We have
                 confirmed that the class II pili of meningococcal strain FAM18
                 (clonal complex 11) are non-variable, and this is also true
                 for the class II pili of strain NMB from clonal complex 8. In
                 addition when a gene encoding class I pilin was moved into the
                 meningococcal strain NMB background there was no evidence of
                 antigenic variation. Finally we investigated several members
                 of the opa gene family of N. gonorrhoeae, where it has been
                 suggested that limited variation occurs. Variation was
                 detected in the opaK gene that is located close to pilE, but
                 not at the opaJ gene located elsewhere on the genome. The
                 approach described here promises to dramatically improve
                 studies of the extent and nature of antigenic variation

                 this study, two lruA mutants, M754 and M765, generated by
                 transposon mutagenesis from Leptospira interrogans serovar
                 Manilae, were characterized. In M754, the transposon inserted
                 in the middle of lruA, resulting in no detectable expression
                 of LruA. In M765, the transposon inserted toward the 3' end of
                 the gene, resulting in expression of a truncated protein. LruA
                 was demonstrated to be on the cell surface in M765 and the
                 wild type (WT). M754, but not M765, was attenuated in a
                 hamster model of acute infection. A search for differential
                 binding to human serum proteins identified a serum protein of
                 around 30 kDa bound to the wild type and the LruA deletion

                 microbiological basis for a sustained increase in bloodstream
                 infections at a major Australian hospital caused by
                 Enterococcus faecium multi-locus sequence type (ST) 203, an
                 outbreak strain that has largely replaced a predecessor ST17
                 sequence type. RESULTS: To establish a ST203 reference
                 sequence we fully assembled and annotated the genome of
                 Aus0085, a 2009 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium
                 (VREfm) bloodstream isolate, and the first example of a
                 completed ST203 genome. Aus0085 has a 3.2 Mb genome,
                 comprising a 2.9 Mb circular chromosome and six circular
                 plasmids (2 kb-130 kb). Twelve percent of the 3222 coding
                 sequences (CDS) in Aus0085 are not present in ST17 E. faecium
                 Aus0004 and ST18 E. faecium TX16. Extending this comparison to
                 an additional 12 ST17 and 14 ST203 E. faecium hospital isolate
                 genomes revealed only six genomic regions spanning 41 kb that
                 were present in all ST203 and absent from all ST17 genomes.
                 The 40 CDS have predicted functions that include ion
                 transport, riboflavin metabolism and two phosphotransferase
                 systems. Comparison of the vancomycin resistance-conferring
                 Tn1549 transposon between Aus0004 and Aus0085 revealed
                 differences in transposon length and insertion site, and van
                 locus sequence variation that correlated with a higher
                 vancomycin MIC in Aus0085. Additional phenotype comparisons
                 between ST17 and ST203 isolates showed that while there were
                 no differences in biofilm-formation and killing of Galleria
                 mellonella, ST203 isolates grew significantly faster and
                 out-competed ST17 isolates in growth assays. CONCLUSIONS: Here
                 we have fully assembled and annotated the first ST203 genome,
                 and then characterized the genomic differences between ST17
                 and ST203 E. faecium. We also show that ST203 E. faecium are
                 faster growing and can out-compete ST17 E. faecium. While a
                 causal genetic basis for these phenotype differences is not
                 provided here, this study revealed conserved genetic
                 differences between the two clones, differences that can now
                 be tested to explain the molecular basis for the success and

                 Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) are thought to occur by
                 transmission of VREfm between patients, predicting that
                 infection control interventions will limit cross-transmission.
                 Despite implementation of such strategies, the incidence of
                 VREfm infections continues to rise. We aimed to use genomics
                 to better understand the epidemiology of E. faecium within a
                 large hospital and investigate the reasons for failure of
                 infection control strategies. Whole-genome sequencing was
                 performed on 61 E. faecium (36 VREfm) isolates, predominately
                 from blood cultures collected at a single hospital between
                 1998 and 2009, and on five vanB-positive anaerobic commensal
                 bacteria isolated from human feces. Phylogenomic analysis and
                 precise mapping of the vanB gene, which contains the Tn1549
                 transposon, showed that at least 18 of the 36 VREfm isolates
                 had acquired the transposon via independent insertion events,
                 indicating de novo generation of VREfm rather than
                 cross-transmission. Furthermore, Tn1549 sequences found in 15
                 of the 36 VREfm isolates were the same as the Tn1549 sequence
                 from one of the gut anaerobes. National and international
                 comparator E. faecium isolates were phylogenetically
                 interspersed with isolates from our hospital, suggesting that
                 our findings might be globally representative. These data
                 demonstrate that VREfm generation within a patient is common,
                 presumably occurring in the human bowel during antibiotic
                 therapy, and help explain our inability to reduce VREfm
                 infections. A recommendation from our findings is that
                 infection control practices should include screening patients
                 for specific hospital clones of vancomycin-susceptible E.
                 faecium rather than just VREfm. IMPORTANCE: Enterococcus
                 faecium is an increasingly important human pathogen causing
                 predominantly antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitalized
                 patients. Large amounts of health care funding are spent
                 trying to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals
                 globally, yet in many institutions around the world,
                 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) infections continue to
                 rise. The new findings from this study help explain the
                 failures of our current approaches to controlling vanB VREfm
                 in health care institutions. Given the importance of this
                 bacterium as a cause of hospital-acquired infections and the
                 difficulties faced by infection control units in trying to
                 prevent colonization in their institutions, the novel findings
                 from this study provide evidence that a new approach to
                 controlling VREfm in hospitals is required. In particular,
                 more attention should be given to understanding the
                 epidemiology of hospital-adapted vancomycin-susceptible E.

                 of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) revealed very

                 clustered with strain or growth phase conditions, the sRNA

                 remain regarding its feasibility, particularly with respect to
                 data analysis in nonspecialist centers. To test the
                 applicability of NGS to outbreak investigations, Ion Torrent
                 sequencing was used to investigate a putative
                 multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli outbreak in the neonatal
                 unit of the Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, Australia.
                 Four suspected outbreak strains and a comparator strain were
                 sequenced. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
                 analysis demonstrated that the four neonatal intensive care
                 unit (NICU) strains were identical and easily differentiated
                 from the comparator strain. Genome sequence data also
                 determined that the NICU strains belonged to multilocus
                 sequence type 131 and carried the bla(CTX-M-15)
                 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Comparison of the outbreak
                 strains to all publicly available complete E. coli genome
                 sequences showed that they clustered with neonatal meningitis
                 and uropathogenic isolates. The turnaround time from a
                 positive culture to the completion of sequencing (prior to
                 data analysis) was 5 days, and the cost was approximately
                 \$300 per strain (for the reagents only). The main obstacles
                 to a mainstream adoption of NGS technologies in diagnostic
                 microbiology laboratories are currently cost (although this is
                 decreasing), a paucity of user-friendly and clinically focused
                 bioinformatics platforms, and a lack of genomics expertise
                 outside the research environment. Despite these hurdles, NGS
                 technologies provide unparalleled high-resolution genotyping

                 proteins (117 of which are hypothetical) that we predict

                 NMB-CDC attached to and invaded host cells at a significantly
                 greater frequency than strain MC58. Type IV pili retained the
                 primary role for initial attachment to host cells for both
                 isolates regardless of pilin class and glycosylation pattern.
                 In strain MC58, the serogroup B capsule was the major
                 inhibitory determinant affecting both bacterial attachment to
                 and invasion of host cells. Removal of terminal sialylation of
                 lipooligosaccharide (LOS) in the presence of capsule did not
                 influence rates of attachment or invasion for strain MC58.
                 However, removal of either serogroup B capsule or LOS
                 sialylation in strain NMB-CDC increased bacterial attachment
                 to host cells to the same extent. Although the level of
                 inhibition of attachment by capsule was different between
                 these strains, the regulation of the capsule synthesis locus
                 by the two-component response regulator MisR, and the level of
                 surface capsule determined by flow cytometry were not
                 significantly different. However, the diplococci of strain
                 NMB-CDC were shown to have a 1.89-fold greater surface area
                 than strain MC58 by flow cytometry. It was proposed that the
                 increase in surface area without changing the amount of
                 anchored glycolipid capsule in the outer membrane would result
                 in a sparser capsule and increase surface hydrophobicity.
                 Strain NMB-CDC was shown to be more hydrophobic than strain
                 MC58 using hydrophobicity interaction chromatography and
                 microbial adhesion-to-solvents assays. In conclusion, improved
                 levels of adherence of strain NMB-CDC to cell lines was
                 associated with increased bacterial cell surface and surface
                 hydrophobicity. This study shows that there is diversity in

                 laboratory colony of the African clawed frog Xenopus
                 tropicalis. This mycobacterium makes mycolactone and is one of
                 several strains of M. ulcerans-like mycolactone-producing
                 mycobacteria recovered from ectotherms around the world. Here,
                 we describe the complete 6,399,543-bp genome of this frog
                 pathogen (previously unofficially named ``Mycobacterium
                 liflandii''), and we show that it has undergone an
                 intermediate degree of reductive evolution between the M.
                 ulcerans Agy99 strain and the fish pathogen Mycobacterium
                 marinum M strain. Like M. ulcerans Agy99, it has the pMUM
                 mycolactone plasmid, over 200 chromosomal copies of the
                 insertion sequence IS2404, and a high proportion of
                 pseudogenes. However, M. liflandii has a larger genome that is
                 closer in length, sequence, and architecture to M. marinum M
                 than to M. ulcerans Agy99, suggesting that the M. ulcerans
                 Agy99 strain has undergone accelerated evolution. Scrutiny of
                 the genes specifically lost suggests that M. liflandii is a
                 tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine auxotroph. A
                 once-extensive M. marinum-like secondary metabolome has also
                 been diminished through reductive evolution. Our analysis
                 shows that M. liflandii, like M. ulcerans Agy99, has the
                 characteristics of a niche-adapted mycobacterium but also has
                 several distinctive features in important metabolic pathways
                 that suggest that it is responding to different environmental
                 pressures, supporting earlier proposals that it could be

  abstract    = "As whole-genome sequencing for cancer genome analysis becomes
                 a clinical tool, a full understanding of the variables
                 affecting sequencing analysis output is required. Here using
                 tumour-normal sample pairs from two different types of cancer,
                 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, we conduct
                 a benchmarking exercise within the context of the
                 International Cancer Genome Consortium. We compare sequencing
                 methods, analysis pipelines and validation methods. We show
                 that using PCR-free methods and increasing sequencing depth to
                 ∼ 100 $\times$ shows benefits, as long as the tumour:control
                 coverage ratio remains balanced. We observe widely varying
                 mutation call rates and low concordance among analysis
                 pipelines, reflecting the artefact-prone nature of the raw
                 data and lack of standards for dealing with the artefacts.
                 However, we show that, using the benchmark mutation set we
                 have created, many issues are in fact easy to remedy and have
                 an immediate positive impact on mutation detection accuracy.",

               has showcased its ability to transform how access to compute
               resources is realized; it delivered on the notion of
               Infrastructure-as-Code and enabled a new wave of compute
               adaptability. In previous work we have been developing CloudMan
               (usecloudman.org) as a versatile solution for enabling and
               managing compute clusters in cloud environments via a simple web
               interface or an API. However, CloudMan only supported batch
               processing workloads. As the magnitude of the data produced and
               processed in digital form grows, the need to support big data
               applications in clusters in the cloud becomes more evident. In
               this paper, we have extended the batch processing capability of
               CloudMan and presenteda novel architecture for supporting big
               data analysis workloads in cluster-in-the-cloud environment. We
               also implemented the details through CloudMan using established

                 group in Australia. Genome sizes were consistent with
                 previously available genomes ranging in length from 30.9 to
                 32.1 Kbp and consisted of 55-65 open reading frames. We
                 analyzed their genetic diversity and found that regions of
                 high diversity are correlated with high recombination rate
                 regions (P value = 0.01). Phylogenetic inference showed two
                 major clades that correlate well with known host range. Using
                 the extended Bayesian Skyline model, we found that population
                 size has remained mostly constant through time. Moreover, the
                 dispersion pattern of these genomes is in agreement with
                 human-driven dispersion as suggested by phylogeographic
                 analysis. In addition, selection analysis found evidence of

                 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium are becoming

                 studies of E. faecium isolates have so far been limited owing
                 to the lack of a fully assembled E. faecium genome sequence.
                 Here we address this issue and report the complete 3.0-Mb
                 genome sequence of the multilocus sequence type 17
                 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain Aus0004,
                 isolated from the bloodstream of a patient in Melbourne,
                 Australia, in 1998. The genome comprises a 2.9-Mb circular
                 chromosome and three circular plasmids. The chromosome harbors
                 putative E. faecium virulence factors such as enterococcal
                 surface protein, hemolysin, and collagen-binding adhesin.
                 Aus0004 has a very large accessory genome (38\%) that includes
                 three prophage and two genomic islands absent among 22 other
                 E. faecium genomes. One of the prophage was present as
                 inverted 50-kb repeats that appear to have facilitated a
                 683-kb chromosomal inversion across the replication terminus,

                 distinctive features include 76 insertion sequence elements

                 using a range of bioinformatic analyses. The draft genomes of

                 reconstruct all genetic changes that occurred. Twenty-three
                 MRSA blood cultures were also obtained during treatment,
                 yielding 44 colony morphotypes that varied in size, haemolysis
                 and antibiotic susceptibility. A subset of 15 isolates was
                 sequenced and shown to harbour a total of 37 sequence
                 polymorphisms. Eighty per cent of all mutations occurred from
                 day 45 onwards, which coincided with the appearance of
                 discrete chromosome expansions, and concluded in the day 115
                 isolate with a 98 kb tandem DNA duplication. In all
                 heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus
                 isolates, the chromosomal amplification spanned at least a 20
                 kb region that notably included mprF, a gene involved in
                 resistance to antimicrobial peptides, and parC, an essential

                 Restoration of the chromosome after serial passage under

                 This study also revealed that long heavy chain complementarity

                 selecting for antibody binding fragments against schistosomule

  abstract    = "Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen of chronic
                 periodontitis. The virulence of P. gingivalis is reported to
                 be strain related and there are currently a number of strain
                 typing schemes based on variation in capsular polysaccharide,
                 the major and minor fimbriae and adhesin domains of
                 Lys-gingipain (Kgp), amongst other surface proteins. P.
                 gingivalis can exchange chromosomal DNA between strains by
                 natural competence and conjugation. The aim of this study was
                 to determine the genetic variability of P. gingivalis strains
                 sourced from international locations over a 25-year period and
                 to determine if variability in surface virulence factors has a
                 phylogenetic basis. Whole genome sequencing was performed on
                 13 strains and comparison made to 10 previously sequenced
                 strains. A single nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenetic
                 analysis demonstrated a shallow tri-lobed phylogeny. There was
                 a high level of reticulation in the phylogenetic network,
                 demonstrating extensive horizontal gene transfer between the
                 strains. Two highly conserved variants of the catalytic domain
                 of the major virulence factor the Kgp proteinase (KgpcatI and
                 KgpcatII) were found. There were three variants of the fourth
                 Kgp C-terminal cleaved adhesin domain. Specific variants of
                 the cell surface proteins FimA, FimCDE, MfaI, RagAB, Tpr, and
                 PrtT were also identified. The occurrence of all these
                 variants in the P. gingivalis strains formed a mosaic that was
                 not related to the SNP-based phylogeny. In conclusion P.
                 gingivalis uses domain rearrangements and genetic exchange to
                 generate diversity in specific surface virulence factors.",

                 establish baselines to predict the response of marine habitats
                 to environmental change, here we report a broad survey of
                 microbial diversity across the Indian Ocean, including the
                 first microbial samples collected in the pristine lagoon of
                 Salomon Islands, Chagos Archipelago. This was the first
                 large-scale ecogenomic survey aboard a private yacht employing
                 a 'citizen oceanography' approach and tools and protocols
                 easily adapted to ocean going sailboats. Our data highlighted
                 biogeographic patterns in microbial community composition
                 across the Indian Ocean. Samples from within the Salomon
                 Islands lagoon contained a community which was different even
                 from adjacent samples despite constant water exchange, driven
                 by the dominance of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium
                 Synechococcus. In the lagoon, Synechococcus was also
                 responsible for driving shifts in the metatranscriptional
                 profiles. Enrichment of transcripts related to photosynthesis
                 and nutrient cycling indicated bottom-up controls of community
                 structure. However a five-fold increase in viral transcripts
                 within the lagoon during the day, suggested a concomitant
                 top-down control by bacteriophages. Indeed, genome recruitment
                 against Synechococcus reference genomes suggested a role of
                 viruses in providing the ecological filter for determining the
                 $\beta$-diversity patterns in this system.",

  abstract    = "The maternally inherited mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is
                 present in multimeric form within cells and harbors sequence
                 variants (heteroplasmy). While a single mtDNA variant at high
                 load can cause disease, naturally occurring variants likely
                 persist at low levels across generations of healthy
                 populations. To determine how naturally occurring variants are
                 segregated and transmitted, we generated a mini-pig model,
                 which originates from the same maternal ancestor. Following
                 next-generation sequencing, we identified a series of
                 low-level mtDNA variants in blood samples from the female
                 founder and her daughters. Four variants, ranging from 3\% to
                 20\%, were selected for validation by high-resolution melting
                 analysis in 12 tissues from 31 animals across three
                 generations. All four variants were maintained in the
                 offspring, but variant load fluctuated significantly across
                 the generations in several tissues, with sex-specific
                 differences in heart and liver. Moreover, variant load was
                 persistently reduced in high-respiratory organs (heart, brain,
                 diaphragm, and muscle), which correlated significantly with
                 higher mtDNA copy number. However, oocytes showed increased
                 heterogeneity in variant load, which correlated with increased
                 mtDNA copy number during in vitro maturation. Altogether,
                 these outcomes show that naturally occurring mtDNA variants
                 segregate and are maintained in a tissue-specific manner
                 across generations. This segregation likely involves the
                 maintenance of selective mtDNA variants during organogenesis,
                 which can be differentially regulated in oocytes and
                 preimplantation embryos during maturation.",

  abstract    = "Vaccine formulations incorporating innate immune stimulants
                 are highly immunogenic; however, the biological signals that
                 originate in the peripheral tissues at the site of injection
                 and are transmitted to the local lymph node to induce immunity
                 remain unclear. By directly cannulating the ovine afferent
                 lymphatic vessels, we have previously shown that it takes 72
                 hr for mature antigen-loaded dendritic cells and monocytes to
                 appear within afferent lymph following injection of a
                 liposomal formulation containing the Toll-like receptor ligand
                 CpG. In this present study, we characterize the global
                 transcriptional signatures at this time-point in ovine
                 afferent lymph cells as they migrate from the injection site
                 into the lymphatics following vaccination with a liposome
                 antigen formulation incorporating CpG. We show that at 72 hr
                 post vaccination, liposomes alone induce no changes in gene
                 expression and inflammatory profiles within afferent lymph;
                 however, the incorporation of CpG drives interferon, antiviral
                 and cytotoxic gene programmes. This study also measures the
                 expression of key genes within individual cell types in
                 afferent lymph. Antiviral gene signatures are most prominent
                 in lymphocytes, which may play a significant and unexpected
                 role in sustaining the immune response to vaccination at the
                 site of injection. These findings provide a comprehensive
                 analysis of the in vivo immunological pathways that connect
                 the injection site with the local draining lymph node
                 following vaccination.",

                 appropriate control, it can cause chronic disease or even
                 provoke fatal responses. Here we identify a mechanism that
                 limits the inflammatory response. Probing the responses of
                 macrophages to the key sensory Toll-like receptors, we
                 identify that the Broad-complex, Tramtrack and
                 Bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ),
                 transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger
                 (PLZF) limits the expression of inflammatory gene products. In
                 accord with this finding, PLZF-deficient animals express
                 higher levels of potent inflammatory cytokines and mount
                 exaggerated inflammatory responses to infectious stimuli.
                 Temporal quantitation of inflammatory gene transcripts shows
                 increased gene induction in the absence of PLZF. Genome-wide
                 analysis of histone modifications distinguish that PLZF
                 establishes basal activity states of early response genes to
                 maintain immune homeostasis and limit damaging inflammation.
                 We show that PLZF stabilizes a corepressor complex that
                 encompasses histone deacetylase activity to control chromatin.
                 Together with our previous demonstration that PLZF promotes
                 the antiviral response, these results suggest a strategy that
                 could realize one of the major goals of immune therapy to

                 specimens are gaining popularity as preclinical models of
                 cancer. However, establishment of PDX lines from small cell
                 lung cancer (SCLC) patients is difficult due to very limited
                 amount of available biopsy material. We asked whether SCLC

                 EBUS-TBNA sampling for diagnostic purposes, we obtained an
                 extra sample for cytologic analysis and implantation into the
                 flanks of immunodeficient mice. Animals were monitored for
                 engraftment for up to 6 months. Histopathologic and
                 immunohistochemical analysis, and targeted next-generation
                 re-sequencing, were then performed in both the primary sample
                 and the derivative PDX line. A total of 12 patients were
                 enrolled in the study. EBUS-TBNA aspirates yielded large
                 numbers of viable tumor cells sufficient to inject between
                 18,750 and 1,487,000 cells per flank, and to yield microgram
                 quantities of high-quality DNA. Of these, samples from 10

                 mean latency of 104 days (range 63-188). All but one
                 maintained a typical SCLC phenotype that closely matched the
                 original sample. Identical mutations that are characteristic
                 of SCLC were identified in both the primary sample and
                 xenograft line. EBUS-TBNA has the potential to be a powerful
                 tool in the development of new targeting strategies for SCLC
                 patients by providing large numbers of viable tumor cells

               Four ddRADseq libraries comprising a total of 88 individuals

                 difficult to align due to low sequence identity and frequent
                 insertions and deletions. RESULTS: Here we present an
                 alignment method that ensures homologous cysteines align by
                 assigning a unique 10 amino acid barcode to those identified
                 as structurally homologous by the DALI webserver. The free
                 inter-cysteine regions of the barcoded sequences can then be
                 aligned using any standard algorithm. Finally the barcodes are
                 replaced with the original columns to yield an alignment which
                 requires the minimum of manual refinement. CONCLUSIONS: Using
                 structural homology information to constrain sequence

              range of taxa. Here, we introduce the GlobalAnts database. *
              Globally, ants are dominant, diverse and provide a range of
              ecosystem functions. The database represents a significant tool
              for ecology in that it (i) contributes to a global archive of ant
              traits (morphology, ecology and life history) which complements
              existing ant databases and (ii) promotes a trait-based approach
              in ant and other insect ecology through a broad set of
              standardised traits. * The GlobalAnts database is unique in that
              it represents the largest online database of functional traits
              with associated georeferenced assemblage-level data (abundance
              and/or occupancy) for any animal group with 9056 ant species and
              morphospecies records for entire local assemblages across 4416
              sites. * We describe the structure of the database, types of
              traits included and present a summary of data coverage. The value
              of the database is demonstrated through an initial examination of
              trait distributions across subfamilies, continents and biomes. *

  abstract    = "Ostensibly hydrophilic alginates are known to foul hydrophobic
                 membranes, under various conditions. Here, controlled
                 experiments have been conducted at high and low pH on the
                 fouling of a polypropylene membrane by alginate and the
                 results suggest that the observed fouling is due to an
                 intrinsic property of the alginate. Thus quantum chemical
                 calculations on the M and G monomers of alginate reveal that M
                 adopts an equilibrium geometry that is hydrophilic on one face
                 and hydrophobic on the other, i.e. is potentially amphiphilic.
                 Molecular dynamics simulations on short alginate chains of
                 different sequences interacting with a modelled polypropylene
                 surface, show that this characteristic is carried over to the
                 polymer and results in hydrophobic patches along the chain
                 that facilitate attractive interactions with the polypropylene
                 surface. This concept is buttressed by an analysis of the
                 binding characteristics of a previously reported X-ray

  abstract = "□ We present a new technique for interactively mining patterns
              and generating explanations by harnessing the expertise of domain
              experts. Key to the approach is the distinction between what is
              unexpected from the perspective of the computational data mining
              process and what is surprising to the domain experts and
              interesting relative to their needs. We demonstrate the potential
              of the approach for discovering patterns and generating rich
              explanations in a clinical domain. Discovering interesting facts
              in clinical data is a grand challenge, because medical
              practitioners and clinicians generally have exceptional knowledge
              in the problem domain in which they work, however, this knowledge
              is typically difficult to isolate computationally. To identify
              the desired surprising patterns, we formally record user
              knowledge and use that knowledge to filter and constrain the
              output from an objective data mining technique, with the user
              making the final judgement about whether a rule is surprising.
              Specifically, we introduce an unexpectedness algorithm based on
              association rule mining and Bayesian Networks and a
              ϵ-explanations technique for explanation generation to identify
              unexpected patterns. An implemented prototype is successfully

                 ~200 million people worldwide. Schistosoma haematobium and S.
                 mansoni are two relatively closely related schistosomes (blood
                 flukes), and the causative agents of urogenital and
                 hepatointestinal schistosomiasis, respectively. The
                 availability of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data
                 sets for these two schistosomes now provides unprecedented
                 opportunities to explore their biology, host interactions and
                 schistosomiasis at the molecular level. A particularly
                 important group of molecules involved in a range of biological
                 and developmental processes in schistosomes and other
                 parasites are the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
                 Although GPCRs have been studied in schistosomes, there has
                 been no detailed comparison of these receptors between closely
                 related species. Here, using a genomic-bioinformatic approach,
                 we identified and characterised key GPCRs in S. haematobium
                 and S. mansoni (two closely related species of schistosome).
                 METHODS: Using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Support Vector
                 Machine (SVM)-based pipeline, we classified and sub-classified
                 GPCRs of S. haematobium and S. mansoni, combined with
                 phylogenetic and transcription analyses. RESULTS: We
                 identified and classified classes A, B, C and F as well as an
                 unclassified group of GPCRs encoded in the genomes of S.
                 haematobium and S. mansoni. In addition, we characterised
                 ligand-specific subclasses (i.e. amine, peptide, opsin and
                 orphan) within class A (rhodopsin-like). CONCLUSIONS: Most
                 GPCRs shared a high degree of similarity and conservation,
                 except for members of a particular clade (designated SmGPR),
                 which appear to have diverged between S. haematobium and S.
                 mansoni and might explain, to some extent, some of the
                 underlying biological differences between these two
                 schistosomes. The present set of annotated GPCRs provides a
                 basis for future functional genomic studies of cellular
                 GPCR-mediated signal transduction and a resource for future
                 drug discovery efforts in schistosomes.",

  abstract    = "Small non-coding RNAs have been significantly recognized as
                 the key modulators in many biological processes, and are
                 emerging as promising biomarkers for several diseases. These
                 RNA species are transcribed in cells and can be packaged in
                 extracellular vesicles, which are small vesicles released from
                 many biotypes, and are involved in intercellular
                 communication. Currently, the advent of next-generation
                 sequencing (NGS) technology for high-throughput profiling has
                 further advanced the biological insights of non-coding RNA on
                 a genome-wide scale and has become the preferred approach for
                 the discovery and quantification of non-coding RNA species.
                 Despite the routine practice of NGS, the processing of large
                 data sets poses difficulty for analysis before conducting
                 downstream experiments. Often, the current analysis tools are
                 designed for specific RNA species, such as microRNA, and are
                 limited in flexibility for modifying parameters for
                 optimization. An analysis tool that allows for maximum control
                 of different software is essential for drawing concrete
                 conclusions for differentially expressed transcripts. Here, we

              number of tumor types including prostate cancer. However, how
              subclonal tumor diversity changes during metastasis and
              progression to lethality remains unexplored. Large scale genomic
              analyses have reported the most prevalent somatic aberrations
              associated with the dominant clone of the tumor without
              permitting an analysis of subclonal complexity or how this
              complexity impinges on metastatic potential or resistance to
              treatment. Methods: To understand and track the evolution of
              lethal prostate cancer from initial therapy to end stage
              metastases, we performed longitudinal and multiregional sampling
              of tumors from 7 patients with lethal prostate cancer. We
              performed whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and SNP
              profiling. Computational approaches were used to reconstruct the
              genetic relationships and evolution of the tumors. These
              evolutionary tree reconstructions allowed us to observe the
              dynamics of chromoplexy and mutational processes along specific
              branches of tumor evolution. To refine the genetic landscape and
              spatial connections between subclones, we employed deep, targeted
              re-sequencing of variant loci in the original sequenced samples,
              in additional FFPE sites sampled from the organ confined tumors,
              and from blood. Results: We show that while all primary and
              metastatic prostate tumors share a single ancestral clone,
              metastases arise from subclones present at minor frequencies in
              the primary tumor. We reveal that individual metastases comprise
              mixtures of subclones indicative of intra-metastatic
              heterogeneity. We provide evidence for cross-metastatic site
              seeding and dynamic remolding of subclonal mixtures in response
              to therapy suggesting a distinct metastatic hierarchy. Ultra-deep
              sequencing of end-stage blood reveals the presence of diverse
              subclones with metastatic potential derived from various stages
              in the evolution of the tumor. Conclusions: Our results
              demonstrate unexpected complexity in the origins of both primary
              and metastatic prostate cancer, with distinct implications for
              treatment of advanced disease.",

                 diversity of tumours changes during metastasis and progression
                 to lethality is poorly understood. Here we reveal the precise
                 direction of metastatic spread across four lethal prostate
                 cancer patients using whole-genome and ultra-deep targeted
                 sequencing of longitudinally collected primary and metastatic
                 tumours. We find one case of metastatic spread to the surgical
                 bed causing local recurrence, and another case of
                 cross-metastatic site seeding combining with dynamic
                 remoulding of subclonal mixtures in response to therapy. By
                 ultra-deep sequencing end-stage blood, we detect both

                 metastasis reveals an enrichment of TP53 mutations, and
                 additional sequencing of metastases from 19 patients
                 demonstrates that acquisition of TP53 mutations is linked with

              and research communities. Similarly, many research communities
              use workflow environments and tools such as Taverna and Galaxy to
              model the execution of tasks to support and expedite the

              repeatability of science. As a result, a number of systems that
              integrate Clouds with these workflow systems have emerged
              including CloudMap, CloudMan, Galaxy Cloud, BioBlend, etc. Though
              these systems have proven to be successful in service and data

              inherent in Cloud-based systems with the outsourced models of

              poses serious challenges regarding the adoption of Cloud
              infrastructures. Yet such domains also have much to gain from

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Analyzing high throughput genomics data is a
                 complex and compute intensive task, generally requiring
                 numerous software tools and large reference data sets, tied
                 together in successive stages of data transformation and
                 visualisation. A computational platform enabling best practice
                 genomics analysis ideally meets a number of requirements,
                 including: a wide range of analysis and visualisation tools,
                 closely linked to large user and reference data sets; workflow
                 platform(s) enabling accessible, reproducible, portable
                 analyses, through a flexible set of interfaces; highly
                 available, scalable computational resources; and flexibility
                 and versatility in the use of these resources to meet demands
                 and expertise of a variety of users. Access to an appropriate
                 computational platform can be a significant barrier to
                 researchers, as establishing such a platform requires a large
                 upfront investment in hardware, experience, and expertise.
                 RESULTS: We designed and implemented the Genomics Virtual
                 Laboratory (GVL) as a middleware layer of machine images,
                 cloud management tools, and online services that enable
                 researchers to build arbitrarily sized compute clusters on
                 demand, pre-populated with fully configured bioinformatics
                 tools, reference datasets and workflow and visualisation
                 options. The platform is flexible in that users can conduct
                 analyses through web-based (Galaxy, RStudio, IPython Notebook)
                 or command-line interfaces, and add/remove compute nodes and
                 data resources as required. Best-practice tutorials and
                 protocols provide a path from introductory training to
                 practice. The GVL is available on the OpenStack-based
                 Australian Research Cloud (http://nectar.org.au) and the
                 Amazon Web Services cloud. The principles, implementation and
                 build process are designed to be cloud-agnostic. CONCLUSIONS:
                 This paper provides a blueprint for the design and
                 implementation of a cloud-based Genomics Virtual Laboratory.
                 We discuss scope, design considerations and technical and
                 logistical constraints, and explore the value added to the

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Ion channels are well characterised in model
                 organisms, principally because of the availability of
                 functional genomic tools and datasets for these species. This
                 contrasts the situation, for example, for parasites of humans
                 and animals, whose genomic and biological uniqueness means
                 that many genes and their products cannot be annotated. As ion
                 channels are recognised as important drug targets in mammals,
                 the accurate identification and classification of parasite
                 channels could provide major prospects for defining unique
                 targets for designing novel and specific anti-parasite
                 therapies. Here, we established a reliable bioinformatic
                 pipeline for the identification and classification of ion
                 channels encoded in the genome of the cancer-causing liver
                 fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, and extended its application to
                 related flatworms affecting humans. METHODS: We built an ion
                 channel identification + classification pipeline (called
                 MuSICC), employing an optimised support vector machine (SVM)
                 model and using the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes
                 (KEGG) classification system. Ion channel proteins were first
                 identified and grouped according to amino acid sequence
                 similarity to classified ion channels and the presence and
                 number of ion channel-like conserved and transmembrane
                 domains. Predicted ion channels were then classified to
                 sub-family using a SVM model, trained using ion channel
                 features. RESULTS: Following an evaluation of this pipeline
                 (MuSICC), which demonstrated a classification sensitivity of
                 95.2 \% and accuracy of 70.5 \% for known ion channels, we
                 applied it to effectively identify and classify ion channels
                 in selected parasitic flatworms. CONCLUSIONS: MuSICC provides
                 a practical and effective tool for the identification and
                 classification of ion channels of parasitic flatworms, and
                 should be applicable to a broad range of organisms that are
                 evolutionarily distant from taxa whose ion channels are
                 functionally characterised.",

               association with UCC risk.Methods:We used 439 case--control
               pairs from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study matched on
               age, sex, country of birth, DNA sample type, and collection
               period. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute odds
               ratios (OR) of UCC risk per s.d. of each genome-wide measure of
               DNA methylation and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted

               disease subtype, sex, smoking, and time since blood
               collection.Results:The risk of superficial UCC was decreased for
               individuals with higher levels of our genome-wide DNA
               methylation measure (OR=0.71, 95\% CI: 0.54--0.94; P=0.02). This
               association was particularly strong for current smokers at
               sample collection (OR=0.47, 95\% CI: 0.27--0.83). Intermediate
               levels of our genome-wide measure were associated with decreased
               risk of invasive UCC. Some variation was observed between UCC

               methylation measure were associated with decreased risk of
               superficial UCC and intermediate levels were associated with

                 processes is electron microscopy (EM). Thus, a common approach

  abstract    = "We reconstructed the synaptic circuits of seven columns in the
                 second neuropil or medulla behind the fly's compound eye.
                 These neurons embody some of the most stereotyped circuits in
                 one of the most miniaturized of animal brains. The
                 reconstructions allow us, for the first time to our knowledge,
                 to study variations between circuits in the medulla's
                 neighboring columns. This variation in the number of synapses
                 and the types of their synaptic partners has previously been
                 little addressed because methods that visualize multiple
                 circuits have not resolved detailed connections, and existing
                 connectomic studies, which can see such connections, have not
                 so far examined multiple reconstructions of the same circuit.
                 Here, we address the omission by comparing the circuits common
                 to all seven columns to assess variation in their connection
                 strengths and the resultant rates of several different and
                 distinct types of connection error. Error rates reveal that,
                 overall, <1\% of contacts are not part of a consensus circuit,
                 and we classify those contacts that supplement (E+) or are
                 missing from it (E-). Autapses, in which the same cell is both
                 presynaptic and postsynaptic at the same synapse, are
                 occasionally seen; two cells in particular, Dm9 and Mi1, form
                 $\geq$ 20-fold more autapses than do other neurons. These
                 results delimit the accuracy of developmental events that
                 establish and normally maintain synaptic circuits with such
                 precision, and thereby address the operation of such circuits.
                 They also establish a precedent for error rates that will be
                 required in the new science of connectomics.",

                 Additional screening of FANCC mutation hotspot exons

                 copper-translocating protein. It contains six similar
                 high-affinity metal-binding domains (MBDs) in the N-terminal
                 cytoplasmic tail that are important for sensing intracellular
                 copper and regulating ATPase function through the transfer of
                 copper between domains. Molecular characterization of
                 copper-binding and transfer is predominantly dependent on NMR
                 structures derived from E. coli expression systems. A
                 limitation of these models is the exclusion of
                 post-translational modifications. We have previously shown
                 that the third copper-binding domain, MBD3, uniquely contains
                 two phosphorylated residues: Thr-327, which is phosphorylated
                 only in the presence of elevated copper; and Ser-339, which is
                 constitutively phosphorylated independent of copper levels.
                 Here, using molecular dynamic simulations, we have
                 incorporated these phosphorylated residues into a model based
                 on the NMR structures of MBD3. Our data suggests that
                 constitutively phosphorylated Ser-339, which is in a loop
                 facing the copper-binding site, may facilitate the copper
                 transfer process by exposing the CxxC copper-binding region of
                 MBD3. Copper-induced phosphorylation of Thr327 is predicted to
                 stabilize this change in conformation. This offers new
                 molecular insights into how cell signaling (phosphorylation)
                 can affect MBD structure and dynamics and how this may in turn

                 profound sensorineural deafness, with no vestibular

                 alters the structural conformation of the protein and affects
                 Ca(2+)-binding properties. Similar to salsa mice, but in
                 contrast to waltzer mice, hair bundle development is normal in
                 jera and hearing loss appears to be due to the loss of tip

  abstract    = "The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) attack cells by
                 punching large holes in their membranes. Lectinolysin from
                 Streptococcus mitis is unique among CDCs due to the presence
                 of an N-terminal lectin domain that enhances the pore-forming
                 activity of the toxin. We recently determined the crystal
                 structures of the lectin domain in complex with various
                 glycans. These structures revealed the molecular basis for the
                 Lewis antigen specificity of the toxin. Based on this
                 information we have used in silico molecular modeling to
                 design a mutant toxin, which we predicted would increase its
                 specificity for Lewis y, an antigen found on the surface of
                 cancer cells. Surprisingly, we found by surface plasmon
                 resonance binding experiments that the resultant mutant lectin
                 domain exhibited higher specificity for Lewis b antigens
                 instead. We then undertook comparative crystallographic and
                 molecular dynamics simulation studies of the wild-type and
                 mutant lectin domains to understand the molecular basis for
                 the disparity between the theoretical and experimental
                 results. The crystallographic results revealed that the net
                 number of interactions between Lewis y and wild-type versus
                 mutant was unchanged whereas there was a loss of a hydrogen
                 bond between mutant and Lewis b compared to wild-type. In
                 contrast, the molecular dynamics studies revealed that the
                 Lewis b antigen spent more time in the binding pocket of the
                 mutant compared to wild-type and the reverse was true for
                 Lewis y. The results of these simulation studies are
                 consistent with the conclusions drawn from the surface plasmon
                 resonance studies. This work is part of a program to engineer

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Searching for structural motifs across known
                 protein structures can be useful for identifying unrelated
                 proteins with similar function and characterising secondary
                 structures such as $\beta$-sheets. This is infeasible using
                 conventional sequence alignment because linear protein
                 sequences do not contain spatial information. $\beta$-residue
                 motifs are $\beta$-sheet substructures that can be represented
                 as graphs and queried using existing graph indexing methods,
                 however, these approaches are designed for general graphs that
                 do not incorporate the inherent structural constraints of
                 $\beta$-sheets and require computationally-expensive filtering
                 and verification procedures. 3D substructure search methods,
                 on the other hand, allow $\beta$-residue motifs to be queried
                 in a three-dimensional context but at significant
                 computational costs. FINDINGS: We developed a new method for
                 querying $\beta$-residue motifs, called BetaSearch, which
                 leverages the natural planar constraints of $\beta$-sheets by
                 indexing them as 2D matrices, thus avoiding much of the
                 computational complexities involved with structural and graph
                 querying. BetaSearch exhibits faster filtering, verification,
                 and overall query time than existing graph indexing approaches
                 whilst producing comparable index sizes. Compared to 3D
                 substructure search methods, BetaSearch achieves 33 and 240
                 times speedups over index-based and pairwise alignment-based
                 approaches, respectively. Furthermore, we have presented
                 case-studies to demonstrate its capability of motif matching
                 in sequentially dissimilar proteins and described a method for
                 using BetaSearch to predict $\beta$-strand pairing.
                 CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that BetaSearch is a fast
                 method for querying substructure motifs. The improvements in
                 speed over existing approaches make it useful for efficiently
                 performing high-volume exploratory querying of possible
                 protein substructural motifs or conformations. BetaSearch was
                 used to identify a nearly identical $\beta$-residue motif
                 between an entirely synthetic (Top7) and a naturally-occurring
                 protein (Charcot-Leyden crystal protein), as well as

                 which is considered critical to virus replication. We studied
                 the helical structure under varying conditions using in silico

                 simulation methods based on the available poliovirus capsid

                 abnormal hearing processes. We present two novel mouse models
                 with mutations in the Myo7a gene with distinct phenotypes. The
                 mutation in Myo7a(I487N/I487N) ewaso is located within the
                 head motor domain of Myo7a. Mice exhibit a profound hearing
                 loss and manifest behaviour associated with a vestibular
                 defect. A mutation located in the linker region between the
                 coiled-coil and the first MyTH4 domains of the protein is
                 responsible in Myo7a(F947I/F947I) dumbo. These mice show a
                 less severe hearing loss than in Myo7a(I487N/I487N) ewaso;
                 their hearing loss threshold is elevated at 4 weeks old, and
                 progressively worsens with age. These mice show no obvious
                 signs of vestibular dysfunction, although scanning electron
                 microscopy reveals a mild phenotype in vestibular stereocilia
                 bundles. The Myo7a(F947I/F947I) dumbo strain is therefore the
                 first reported Myo7a mouse model without an overt vestibular
                 phenotype; a possible model for human DFNB2 deafness.
                 Understanding the molecular basis of these newly identified
                 mutations will provide knowledge into the complex genetic
                 pathways involved in the maintenance of hearing, and will

                 bacterial toxins that exhibit a dependence on the presence of
                 membrane cholesterol in forming large pores in cell membranes.
                 Significant changes in the three-dimensional structure of
                 these toxins are necessary to convert the soluble monomeric
                 protein into a membrane pore. We have determined the crystal
                 structure of the archetypical member of the CDC family,
                 streptolysin O (SLO), a virulence factor from Streptococcus
                 pyogenes. The overall fold is similar to previously reported
                 CDC structures, although the C-terminal domain is in a
                 different orientation with respect to the rest of the
                 molecule. Surprisingly, a signature stretch of CDC sequence
                 called the undecapeptide motif, a key region involved in
                 membrane recognition, adopts a very different structure in SLO
                 to that of the well-characterized CDC perfringolysin O (PFO),
                 although the sequences in this region are identical. An
                 analysis reveals that, in PFO, there are complementary
                 interactions between the motif and the rest of domain 4 that
                 are lost in SLO. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that
                 the loss of a salt bridge in SLO and a cation-pi interaction
                 are determining factors in the extended conformation of the
                 motif, which in turn appears to result in a greater
                 flexibility of the neighboring L1 loop that houses a
                 cholesterol-sensing motif. These differences may explain the

                 protein structure-function mechanism for the spruce budworm
                 Choristoneura fumiferana AFP, including stereo-specific
                 binding and consequential melting and freezing inhibition. The
                 protein binds indirectly to the prism ice face through a
                 linear array of ordered water molecules that are structurally
                 distinct from the ice. Mutation of the ice binding surface
                 disrupts water-ordering and abolishes activity. The adsorption
                 is virtually irreversible, and we confirm the ice growth
                 inhibition is consistent with the Gibbs-Thomson law.",

                 pore-forming toxins that punch holes in the outer membrane of
                 eukaryotic cells. Cholesterol serves as the receptor, but a
                 subclass of CDCs first binds to human CD59. Here we describe
                 the crystal structures of vaginolysin and intermedilysin
                 complexed to CD59. These studies, together with small-angle

                 though overlapping, sites, consistent with molecular dynamics
                 simulations and binding studies. The CDC consensus
                 undecapeptide motif, which for the CD59-responsive CDCs has a
                 proline instead of a tryptophan in the motif, adopts a
                 strikingly different conformation between the structures; our
                 data suggest that the proline acts as a selectivity switch to
                 ensure CD59-dependent CDCs bind their protein receptor first
                 in preference to cholesterol. The structural data suggest a

                 utility of singleton whole-exome sequencing (WES) as a
                 first-tier test in infants with suspected monogenic disease.
                 METHODS: Singleton WES was performed as a first-tier
                 sequencing test in infants recruited from a single pediatric
                 tertiary center. This occurred in parallel with standard
                 investigations, including single- or multigene panel
                 sequencing when clinically indicated. The diagnosis rate,
                 clinical utility, and impact on management of singleton WES
                 were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 80 enrolled infants, 46 received a
                 molecular genetic diagnosis through singleton WES (57.5\%)
                 compared with 11 (13.75\%) who underwent standard
                 investigations in the same patient group. Clinical management
                 changed following exome diagnosis in 15 of 46 diagnosed
                 participants (32.6\%). Twelve relatives received a genetic
                 diagnosis following cascade testing, and 28 couples were
                 identified as being at high risk of recurrence in future
                 pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study provides
                 strong evidence for increased diagnostic and clinical utility
                 of singleton WES as a first-tier sequencing test for infants
                 with a suspected monogenic disorder. Singleton WES
                 outperformed standard care in terms of diagnosis rate and the

              such breaks and their subsequent resolution are also highly
              relevant to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, in which
              extensive DNA fragmentation has been described Stephens et al.
              (2011), Blondet et al. (2001) . Tchurikov et al. Tchurikov et al.
              (2011, 2013) have reported previously that frequent sites of DSBs
              occur in chromosomal domains involved in the co-ordinated
              expression of genes. This group report that hot spots of DSBs in
              human HEK293T cells often coincide with H3K4me3 marks, associated
              with active transcription Kravatsky et al. (2015) and that
              frequent sites of DNA double-strand breakage are likely to be
              relevant to cancer genomics Tchurikov et al. (2013, 2016) .
              Recently, they applied a RAFT (rapid amplification of forum
              termini) protocol that selects for blunt-ended DSB sites and
              mapped these to the human genome within defined co-ordinate
              ‘windows’. In this paper, we re-analyse public RAFT data to
              derive sites of DSBs at the single-nucleotide level across the
              built genome for human HEK293T cells
              (https://figshare.com/s/35220b2b79eaaaf64ed8). This refined
              mapping, combined with accessory ENCODE data tracks and ribosomal
              DNA-related sequence annotations, will likely be of value for the
              design of clinically relevant targeted assays such as those for

                 computing (HPC) systems. We anticipate that computationally
                 efficient multiscale models will require the use of
                 sophisticated hybrid programming models, mixing distributed
                 message-passing processes [e.g., the message-passing interface
                 (MPI)] with multithreading (e.g., OpenMP, Pthreads). The
                 objective of this study is to compare the performance of such
                 hybrid programming models when applied to the simulation of a
                 realistic physiological multiscale model of the heart. Our
                 results show that the hybrid models perform favorably when
                 compared to an implementation using only the MPI and,
                 furthermore, that OpenMP in combination with the MPI provides
                 a satisfactory compromise between performance and code
                 complexity. Having the ability to use threads within MPI
                 processes enables the sophisticated use of all processor cores
                 for both computation and communication phases. Considering
                 that HPC systems in 2012 will have two orders of magnitude
                 more cores than what was used in this study, we believe that
                 faster than real-time multiscale cardiac simulations can be
                 achieved on these systems.",

                 central nervous system (CNS) development, allowing for rapid
                 and energy efficient saltatory conduction of nerve impulses.
                 Accordingly, the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the
                 myelinating cells of the CNS, and their expression of myelin
                 genes are under tight transcriptional control. We previously
                 identified a putative transcription factor, Myelin Regulatory
                 Factor (Myrf), as being vital for CNS myelination. Myrf is
                 required for the generation of CNS myelination during
                 development and also for its maintenance in the adult. It has
                 been controversial, however, whether Myrf directly regulates
                 transcription, with reports of a transmembrane domain and lack
                 of nuclear localization. Here we show that Myrf is a
                 membrane-associated transcription factor that undergoes an
                 activating proteolytic cleavage to separate its transmembrane
                 domain-containing C-terminal region from a nuclear-targeted
                 N-terminal region. Unexpectedly, this cleavage event occurs
                 via a protein domain related to the autoproteolytic
                 intramolecular chaperone domain of the bacteriophage tail
                 spike proteins, the first time this domain has been found to
                 play a role in eukaryotic proteins. Using ChIP-Seq we show
                 that the N-terminal cleavage product directly binds the
                 enhancer regions of oligodendrocyte-specific and myelin genes.
                 This binding occurs via a defined DNA-binding consensus
                 sequence and strongly promotes the expression of target genes.
                 These findings identify Myrf as a novel example of a
                 membrane-associated transcription factor and provide a direct
                 molecular mechanism for its regulation of oligodendrocyte
                 differentiation and CNS myelination.",

                 success of a new drug lead. Thus, significant effort is
                 directed toward identifying the metabolites formed from a
                 given molecule. Here, an automated and nontargeted procedure
                 is introduced for detecting drug metabolites without authentic
                 metabolite standards via the use of stable isotope labeling,
                 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and
                 high-performance computing. LC/MS of blood plasma extracts
                 from rats that were administered a 1:1 mixture of
                 acetaminophen (APAP) and (13)C6-APAP resulted in mass spectra
                 that contained ``twin'' ions for drug metabolites that were
                 not detected in control spectra (i.e., no APAP administered).
                 Because of the development of a program (high-resolution
                 twin-ion metabolite extraction; HiTIME) that can identify
                 twin-ions in high-resolution mass spectra without centroiding
                 (i.e., reduction of mass spectral peaks to single data
                 points), 9 doublets corresponding to APAP metabolites were
                 identified. This is nearly twice that obtained by use of
                 existing programs that make use of centroiding to reduce
                 computational cost under these conditions with a quadrupole
                 time-of-flight mass spectrometer. By a manual search for all
                 reported APAP metabolite ions, no additional twin-ion signals
                 were assigned. These data indicate that all the major
                 metabolites of APAP and multiple low-abundance metabolites
                 (e.g., acetaminophen hydroxy- and methoxysulfate) that are

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is a complex epigenetic marker
                 that can be analyzed using a wide variety of methods.
                 Interpretation and visualization of DNA methylation data can
                 mask complexity in terms of methylation status at each CpG
                 site, cellular heterogeneity of samples and allelic DNA
                 methylation patterns within a given DNA strand. Bisulfite
                 sequencing is considered the gold standard, but visualization
                 of massively parallel sequencing results remains a significant
                 challenge. FINDINGS: We created a program called Methpat that
                 facilitates visualization and interpretation of bisulfite
                 sequencing data generated by massively parallel sequencing. To
                 demonstrate this, we performed multiplex PCR that targeted 48
                 regions of interest across 86 human samples. The regions
                 selected included known gene promoters associated with cancer,
                 repetitive elements, known imprinted regions and mitochondrial
                 genomic sequences. We interrogated a range of samples
                 including human cell lines, primary tumours and primary tissue
                 samples. Methpat generates two forms of output: a
                 tab-delimited text file for each sample that summarizes DNA
                 methylation patterns and their read counts for each amplicon,
                 and a HTML file that summarizes this data visually. Methpat
                 can be used with publicly available whole genome bisulfite
                 sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing
                 datasets with sufficient read depths. CONCLUSIONS: Using
                 Methpat, complex DNA methylation data derived from massively
                 parallel sequencing can be summarized and visualized for
                 biological interpretation. By accounting for allelic DNA
                 methylation states and their abundance in a sample, Methpat
                 can unmask the complexity of DNA methylation and yield further
                 biological insight in existing datasets.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: DNA methylation at a gene promoter region has the
                 potential to regulate gene transcription. Patterns of
                 methylation over multiple CpG sites in a region are often
                 complex and cell type specific, with the region showing
                 multiple allelic patterns in a sample. This complexity is
                 commonly obscured when DNA methylation data is summarised as
                 an average percentage value for each CpG site (or aggregated
                 across CpG sites). True representation of methylation patterns
                 can only be fully characterised by clonal analysis. Deep
                 sequencing provides the ability to investigate clonal DNA
                 methylation patterns in unprecedented detail and scale,
                 enabling the proper characterisation of the heterogeneity of
                 methylation patterns. However, the sheer amount and complexity
                 of sequencing data requires new synoptic approaches to
                 visualise the distribution of allelic patterns. RESULTS: We
                 have developed a new analysis and visualisation software tool
                 ``Methpat'', that extracts and displays clonal DNA methylation
                 patterns from massively parallel sequencing data aligned using
                 Bismark. Methpat was used to analyse multiplex bisulfite
                 amplicon sequencing on a range of CpG island targets across a
                 panel of human cell lines and primary tissues. Methpat was
                 able to represent the clonal diversity of epialleles analysed
                 at specific gene promoter regions. We also used Methpat to
                 describe epiallelic DNA methylation within the mitochondrial
                 genome. CONCLUSIONS: Methpat can summarise and visualise
                 epiallelic DNA methylation results from targeted amplicon,
                 massively parallel sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA in a
                 compact and interpretable format. Unlike currently available
                 tools, Methpat can visualise the diversity of epiallelic DNA

                 recombination and that rDNA restructuring is among the most
                 common chromosomal alterations in adult solid tumours. As
                 such, analysis of rDNA regions is likely to have significant
                 prognostic and predictive value, clinically. Tchurikov et al.
                 (2015a, 2016) Tchurikov et al. (2015a, 2016) [7], [9] have
                 made major advances in this direction, reporting that sites of
                 human genome double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur frequently at
                 sites in rDNA that are tightly linked with active
                 transcription - the authors used a RAFT (rapid amplification
                 of forum termini) protocol that selects for blunt-ended sites.
                 They reported the relative frequency of these rDNA DSBs within
                 defined co-ordinate 'windows' of varying size and made these
                 data (as well as the relevant 'raw' sequencing information)
                 available to the public (Tchurikov et al., 2015b). Assay
                 designs targeting rDNA DSB hotspots will benefit greatly from
                 the publication of break sites at greater resolution. Here, we
                 re-analyse public RAFT data and make available rDNA DSB

                 relevant to orbital inflammation and orbital fat expansion in
                 thyroid orbitopathy (TO) using microarray gene profiling in a
                 case-control study. METHODS: Human orbital adipose samples
                 were obtained from individuals with active TO (n = 12),
                 inactive TO (n = 21), and normal controls (n = 21). Gene
                 expression profiles were examined using microarray analysis
                 and were compared between active and inactive TO, and between
                 active TO and normal controls. Top ranked differentially
                 expressed genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR in an
                 additional eight active TO, 13 inactive TO, and 11 normal
                 controls and correlated with gene set enrichment analysis
                 (GSEA) and molecular pathways analysis. RESULTS: Seven hundred
                 twenty-one probes (683 genes) and 806 probes (735 genes) were
                 significantly differentially expressed in comparing active to
                 inactive TO and in comparing active TO to healthy controls,
                 respectively. All selected genes were confirmed to be
                 differentially expressed by real-time RT-PCR. Multiple top
                 ranked genes in active versus inactive TO comparison are
                 overrepresented by immune and inflammatory response genes.
                 They include defensins (DEFA1, DEFA1B, DEFA3), which were
                 overexpressed by 3.05- to 4.14-fold and TIMD4 by 4.20-fold.
                 Markers for adipogenesis were overexpressed including SCD,
                 FADS1, and SCDP1. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed
                 dysregulation of epigenetic signatures, T-cell activation, Th1

                 organization, apoptosis, cell cycling, and lipid metabolism in
                 active TO. CONCLUSIONS: Active TO is characterized by
                 upregulation of genes involved in cell-mediated immune, innate
                 immune, and inflammatory response and enhanced orbital
                 adipogenesis. TIMD4, DEFA1, DEFA1B, and DEFA3 genes may be

              the preferred approach for the discovery and quantification of
              non-coding RNA species. Despite the routine practice of NGS, the
              processing of large data sets poses difficulty for analysis
              before conducting downstream experiments. Often, the current
              analysis tools are designed for specific RNA species, such as
              microRNA, and are limited in flexibility for modifying parameters
              for optimization. An analysis tool that allows for maximum
              control of different software is essential for drawing concrete
              conclusions for differentially expressed transcripts. Here, we
              developed a one-touch integrated small RNA analysis pipeline
              (iSRAP) research tool that is composed of widely used tools for
              rapid profiling of small RNAs. The performance test of iSRAP
              using publicly and in-house available data sets shows its ability
              of comprehensive profiling of small RNAs of various classes, and
              analysis of differentially expressed small RNAs. iSRAP offers
              comprehensive analysis of small RNA sequencing data that leverage
              informed decisions on the downstream analyses of small RNA
              studies, including extracellular vesicles such as exosomes.

                 studies. Repeated HM450K methylation measures in DNA from DBS
                 and PBMC samples were available from participants in six
                 case-control studies nested within the Melbourne Collaborative
                 Cohort Study. Reliability was assessed for individual CpGs by
                 calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) based
                 on technical replicates (samples repeated in a single study;
                 126 PBMC, 136 DBS) and study duplicates (samples repeated
                 across studies; 280 PBMC, 769 DBS) using mixed-effects models.
                 Reliability based on technical replicates was moderate for
                 PBMC (median ICC = 0.42), but lower for DBS (median ICC =
                 0.20). Study duplicates gave lower ICCs than technical
                 replicates. CpGs that were either highly methylated or
                 unmethylated generally had lower ICCs, which appeared to be
                 mostly related to their lower variability. The ICCs for global
                 methylation measures were high, typically greater than 0.70.
                 The reliability of methylation measures determined by the
                 HM450K microarray is wide-ranging and depends primarily on the
                 variability in methylation at individual CpG sites. The power
                 of association studies is low for a substantial proportion of

                 Nested case-control study within the prospective Melbourne

                 before-diagnosis blood samples (420 incident cases and matched

                 epigenome-wide methylation, quantified as the mean beta values
                 across the CpGs, in relation to breast cancer risk were
                 estimated using conditional logistic regression. Overall, the

                 three steps process: (i) identify all putative homologs
                 between the genomes, (ii) identify gene anchors and (iii) link
                 anchors to identify best gene matches given their order and
                 context. In this article, we engineer two methods to improve
                 two important aspects of this pipeline [specifically steps
                 (ii) and (iii)]. First, computing sequence similarity data
                 [step (i)] is a computationally intensive task for large
                 sequence sets, creating a bottleneck in the ortholog
                 assignment pipeline. We have designed a fast and highly
                 scalable sort-join method (afree) based on k-mer counts to
                 rapidly compare all pairs of sequences in a large protein
                 sequence set to identify putative homologs. Second,
                 availability of complex genomes containing large gene families
                 with prevalence of complex evolutionary events, such as
                 duplications, has made the task of assigning orthologs and
                 co-orthologs difficult. Here, we have developed an iterative
                 graph matching strategy where at each iteration the best gene
                 assignments are identified resulting in a set of orthologs and
                 co-orthologs. We find that the afree algorithm is faster than
                 existing methods and maintains high accuracy in identifying
                 similar genes. The iterative graph matching strategy also
                 showed high accuracy in identifying complex gene

                 giant antiparallel $\beta$-barrels, such as those formed by
                 pore forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC), are
                 parallel relative to the axis of the $\beta$-barrel, i.e. S=0.
                 The S=0 arrangement, however, has never been observed in
                 crystal structures of small $\beta$-barrels. Therefore, the
                 structural basis for how CDCs form a $\beta$-barrel and span a
                 membrane remains to be understood. RESULTS: Through comparison
                 of molecular models with experimental data, we are able to
                 identify how giant CDC $\beta$-barrels utilize a 'near
                 parallel' arrangement of $\beta$-strands where S=n/2.
                 Furthermore, we show how side-chain packing within the
                 $\beta$-barrel lumen is an important limiting factor with
                 respect to the possible shear values for small $\beta$-barrels
                 (n$\leq$24 $\beta$-strands). In contrast, our models reveal no
                 such limitation restricts the shear value of giant
                 $\beta$-barrels (n>24 $\beta$-strands). Giant $\beta$-barrels
                 can thus access a different architecture compared with smaller
                 $\beta$-barrels.",

                 syndrome, initially responsive to antiepileptic drugs which
                 over time becomes refractory and can be associated with
                 cognitive decline. Linkage analysis was performed and the

                 enormous potential to significantly improve our understanding
                 of the genetic basis for observed phenotypes, including
                 predisposition to and progression of complex human disease.
                 Great challenges remain in resolving genetic variants that are
                 genuine from the millions of artefactual signals. RESULTS:
                 FAVR is a suite of new methods designed to work with commonly
                 used MPS analysis pipelines to assist in the resolution of
                 some of the issues related to the analysis of the vast amount
                 of resulting data, with a focus on relatively rare genetic
                 variants. To the best of our knowledge, no equivalent method
                 has previously been described. The most important and novel
                 aspect of FAVR is the use of signatures in comparator sequence
                 alignment files during variant filtering, and annotation of
                 variants potentially shared between individuals. The FAVR
                 methods use these signatures to facilitate filtering of (i)
                 platform and/or mapping-specific artefacts, (ii) common
                 genetic variants, and, where relevant, (iii) artefacts derived
                 from imbalanced paired-end sequencing, as well as annotation
                 of genetic variants based on evidence of co-occurrence in
                 individuals. We applied conventional variant calling applied
                 to whole-exome sequencing datasets, produced using both SOLiD
                 and TruSeq chemistries, with or without downstream processing
                 by FAVR methods. We demonstrate a 3-fold smaller rare single
                 nucleotide variant shortlist with no detected reduction in
                 sensitivity. This analysis included Sanger sequencing of rare
                 variant signals not evident in dbSNP131, assessment of known
                 variant signal preservation, and comparison of observed and
                 expected rare variant numbers across a range of first cousin
                 pairs. The principles described herein were applied in our

                 large volumes of sequencing data for the study of rare genetic

                 25 ng FFPE-derived DNA, 95.14\% of mapped reads were on-target
                 and relative representation ranged from 10.1-fold lower to
                 5.8-fold higher than the mean. These results were obtained
                 using only the initial automatically-designed primers present

                 revolutionised biomedical research and offers enormous
                 capacity for clinical application. We previously reported
                 Hi-Plex, a streamlined highly-multiplexed PCR-MPS approach,
                 allowing a given library to be sequenced with both the Ion
                 Torrent and TruSeq chemistries. Comparable sequencing
                 efficiency was achieved using material derived from
                 lymphoblastoid cell lines and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
                 tumour. METHODS: Here, we report high-throughput application
                 of Hi-Plex by performing blinded mutation screening of the
                 coding regions of the breast cancer susceptibility gene PALB2
                 on a set of 95 blood-derived DNA samples that had previously
                 been screened using Sanger sequencing and high-resolution
                 melting curve analysis (n = 90), or genotyped by Taqman
                 probe-based assays (n = 5). Hi-Plex libraries were prepared
                 simultaneously using relatively inexpensive, readily available
                 reagents in a simple half-day protocol followed by MPS on a
                 single MiSeq run. RESULTS: We observed that 99.93\% of
                 amplicons were represented at $\geq$10X coverage. All 56
                 previously identified variant calls were detected and no false
                 positive calls were assigned. Four additional variant calls
                 were made and confirmed upon re-analysis of previous data or
                 subsequent Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: These results
                 support Hi-Plex as a powerful approach for rapid,
                 cost-effective and accurate high-throughput mutation
                 screening. They further demonstrate that Hi-Plex methods are
                 suitable for and can meet the demands of high-throughput
                 genetic testing in research and clinical settings.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: We recently described Hi-Plex, a highly
                 multiplexed PCR-based target-enrichment system for massively
                 parallel sequencing (MPS), which allows the uniform definition
                 of library size so that subsequent paired-end sequencing can
                 achieve complete overlap of read pairs. Variant calling from
                 Hi-Plex-derived datasets can thus rely on the identification
                 of variants appearing in both reads of read-pairs, permitting
                 stringent filtering of sequencing chemistry-induced errors.
                 These principles underly ROVER software (derived from Read
                 Overlap PCR-MPS variant caller), which we have recently used
                 to report the screening for genetic mutations in the breast
                 cancer predisposition gene PALB2. Here, we describe the
                 algorithms underlying ROVER and its usage. RESULTS: ROVER
                 enables users to quickly and accurately identify genetic
                 variants from PCR-targeted, overlapping paired-end MPS
                 datasets. The open-source availability of the software and
                 threshold tailorability enables broad access for a range of
                 PCR-MPS users. METHODS: ROVER is implemented in Python and
                 runs on all popular POSIX-like operating systems (Linux, OS
                 X). The software accepts a tab-delimited text file listing the
                 coordinates of the target-specific primers used for targeted
                 enrichment based on a specified genome-build. It also accepts
                 aligned sequence files resulting from mapping to the same
                 genome-build. ROVER identifies the amplicon a given read-pair
                 represents and removes the primer sequences by using the
                 mapping co-ordinates and primer co-ordinates. It considers
                 overlapping read-pairs with respect to primer-intervening
                 sequence. Only when a variant is observed in both reads of a
                 read-pair does the signal contribute to a tally of read-pairs
                 containing or not containing the variant. A user-defined
                 threshold informs the minimum number of, and proportion of,
                 read-pairs a variant must be observed in for a 'call' to be
                 made. ROVER also reports the depth of coverage across
                 amplicons to facilitate the identification of any regions that
                 may require further screening. CONCLUSIONS: ROVER can
                 facilitate rapid and accurate genetic variant calling for a
                 broad range of PCR-MPS users.",

                 cancer family exome-sequencing study identified three likely
                 pathogenic mutations in RINT1 (NM\_021930.4) not present in
                 public sequencing databases: RINT1 c.343C>T (p.Q115X),
                 c.1132\_1134del (p.M378del), and c.1207G>T (p.D403Y). On the

                 mutation-screening study was conducted that identified 29
                 carriers of rare (minor allele frequency < 0.5\%), likely
                 pathogenic variants: 23 in 1,313 early-onset breast cancer

                 associated with risk of developing mature B-cell neoplasms
                 (MBCNs). MATERIALS \& METHODS: We conducted a case-control
                 study nested within a large prospective cohort. Peripheral
                 blood was collected from healthy participants. Cases of MBCN
                 were identified by linkage to cancer registries. Methylation
                 was measured using the Infinium(\textregistered{})
                 HumanMethylation450. RESULTS: During a median of 10.6-year
                 follow-up, 438 MBCN cases were evaluated. Global
                 hypomethylation was associated with increased risk of MBCN
                 (odds ratio: 2.27, [95\% CI: 1.59-3.25]). Within high CpG
                 promoter regions, hypermethylation was associated with
                 increased risk (odds ratio: 1.76 [95\% CI: 1.25-2.48]).
                 Promoter hypermethylation was observed in HOXA9 and CDH1
                 genes. CONCLUSION: Aberrant global DNA methylation is
                 detectable in peripheral blood collected years before
                 diagnosis and is associated with increased risk of MBCN,
                 suggesting changes to DNA methylation are an early event in
                 MBCN development.",

              ROVER permits stringent filtering of sequencing chemistry-induced

              overlapping pairs above certain thresholds of occurrence. ROVER
